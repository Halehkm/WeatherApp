## Project Description 

This was my first coding project! I am very excited and proud to have built this. It was such a big and fun challenge to have learned coding from scratch and putting all that knowledge into building a functional application! Though this isn't anything original nor high quality coding, it is proof that anyone can learn to code so long as they are willing to learn, fail, and learn more. 

## Criteria

I was asked to Build a weather app with a search engine and API integration hosted on Netlify. The criteria did not ask for the time and the F to C conversion. I took it upon myself to further learn how to make these work. It was very challenging to figure out these two aspects. As I was searching for the time zone issue and asking for help, I came to realize this is a problem that even seasoned engineers struggle with. I was able to find an API for different time zones and with its integration into my code, the problem was solved! I was so excited that it was working because it took me a long time to get it figured out, but once it did, they joy was greater than the frustrations I had gone through for days.
